Script will parse a website and find the e-mail addresses using REGEX.
Next release will follow a variable number of links on the website to aide in scanning and entire website rather than one page.

Usage:
Using python 2.7, execute emailScrape.py
Enter website to scrape
E-mails will output to screen

Pass in a list of websites, and it will scrape them and output to a file.

chmod +x emailScrape.py
./emailScrape.py addresses.txt

Output will be: output.txt

Enjoy!
